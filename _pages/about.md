This is Dr. Xu's home on the web!

Dr. Xu Hui is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Peter Boris Centre for Addictions Research at McMaster University. His research mainly focused on two fundamental aspects of brain disorders—neuroimaging biomarkers and underlying mechanism of intervention treatment with multimodal MRI techniques (structural MRI, diffusion MRI, resting-state fMRI, and tasking-state fMRI) and machine learning methods.
